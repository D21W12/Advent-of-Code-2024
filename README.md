# Advent of Code 2024 ðŸŽ„ðŸŒŸ

***

The Advent of Code (AoC) is a yearly coding competition/event held from the 1st of December until Christmas. This repository contains all my answers of the AoC 2024.

The solutions found in this repository are fully created by me (Daan Wichmann). Credits are given for everything that was inspired by or assisted by anyone else.

Description of the Advent of Code from the official website:
> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.
